Title: First lady without choice?

Germany is about to get a new president. He — yes, the position has been male-exclusive so far — does have mostly representative duties and not much power, and gets elected by an extended parliarment. Since the majority parties already have agreed upon a common candidate, current foreign minister Steinmeier, he is most likely to succeed president Gauck.

The reason I write this is the question asked by SpiegelOnline in their pay-walled section (not worth a link): Can Steinmeier's wife keep her job as a judge when she becomes "first lady"?

What the hell, SpOn? Well done propagating the antiquated norm that women should give up their careers whenever it fits the husband. What about asking whether Steinmeier can take the job, if his wife's profession really poses a conflict of interest?
