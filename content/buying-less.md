It is possible to convince oneself that *not* buying stuff is better than to
do it. I mean this not in a superficial sense like thinking of a good argument
why it would be better to refrain from a purchase, but in the deeper sense of
mentally exercising to get off the hedonic treadmill. Letting the brain's
reward respose trigger not by clicking "Buy" on that webshop, but just before,
and then closing that browser tab, happily avoiding another thing that might
have been nice to have, but ultimately neither necessary nor fulfilling.

Related to that, I find that renovating and repairing things can be very
rewading as well. The shoe rack or the table start to look shabby? Give them a
new layer of paint! It probably takes less time than finding a replacement
anyway. Get a sewing machine! They are a truly ingenious invention. Those dog
toys or clothes for exercising need not be pretty, just functional.

Most important I find the insight that, sure, there are newer better nicer
versions of anything that you have, but it is liberating not having to think
about the next new thing, as long as the old one does the job and is *good
enough*. My six year old laptop is quite beat-up by now and will not make it
that much longer, but it is still fully functional and I am happily pushing the
environmental and mental burdens of replacing it further into the future.
