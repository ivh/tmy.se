I remember it blew my mind a little in high-school, that loudspeakers and microphones are the same thing, in principle. A membrane with a magnet and a coil that you either use to drive or to measure.


It should therefore maybe not come as a surprise that the headphones that you plug into your computer [can be used to spy on you](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/11/headphones_as_m.html).
