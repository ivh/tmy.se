I don't write the posts for this blog in advance. Sure, there are a few files with an idea or a link that I want to write about eventually.
But nothing finished
that I can release if I don't feel like blogging today, but don't want to break the streak. So I have to come up with something, right now.

As you might remember from previous posts, I live somewhat isolated in the forest. The town is only 20 minutes away, but still. There are no 
direct neighbours and in times like now, working from home, and because of the abysmal weather this week with another two days of snow in late
April, it just so happened that I did not get out to meet anybody, or see anything new for quite a while. Except through the screen, of course.

This morning I therefore got in the car and drove downtown. Not to go shopping, I can resist that particular urge and like being
[frugal]({filename}broken.md). But to take a long walk at a decent pace, like a small hike of ~7km, just to see something different.
Towns-folk likes to take hikes in the woods, I do the reverse. At least today I did. Maybe that's part of how people get
a bit weird after a few years living in the forest.

When I came by [the cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppsala_Cathedral),I went in. The early Saturday morning meant I was alone inside.
It's been years since I've been inside. Gothic cathedrals are always uplifting, if you let them get to you. For me this means ignoring the
religious veneer and see the whole as a cultural and aesthetic achievement. Plus, it is historically significant, with
[Gustav Vasa's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_I_of_Sweden) pompous grave, among other things.

I hope I won't forget this once everything gets back to normal, the right now
very appealing idea to visit all museums in town. I've never even been to the
one for [natural history](http://www.evolutionsmuseet.uu.se/indexeng.html) during
all the years I've been living here.
