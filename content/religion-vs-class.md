I saw a claim on Twitter that made me think: 
> If you think it's crazy how much a child's life is affected by being born into a religion, wait until you hear about class!

(my translation [from Swedish](https://twitter.com/fiskargubbe/status/1179682051877933056))

My first reaction was, *No way! Religions are much more restrictive.* But then again, I guess it depends very much on the context. 
Even in secular societies it can be hard to break out of a cultish religious context, but I won't deny that class might be more limiting for most.
To make the same case for other places in the world, like women in the middle east and central asia, would be more difficult.
