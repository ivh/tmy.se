You know the saying _"the exception that proves the rule"_. If you are a
non-British European like myself, chances are that that this expression exists
in your native language as well.  To name just the tree that come to mind
immediately:

* German: _Die Ausnahme bestätigt die Regel_
* Swedish: _Undantaget som bekräftar regeln_
* French: _L'exception qui confirme la règle_

The problem is that these treat the word _prove_ as meaning _to give proof for_
or _confirm_. It can mean that, for sure, but it can also mean _to put to the
test_! Swedish even has the word _pröva_, with presumably the same origin as
_prove_, which means exactly that.

Is it presumptuous to think that this would have been a better translation?
After all, it does not really make any sense that an exception should count
as evidence _for_ a rule. It should diminish our credence in it, a good
counter-example can completely disprove a rule. It makes however perfect
sense to think that an exception _tests_ a rule. In fact I was happy when
I realized this misunderstanding some while ago because I never liked the
expression before.

Nevertheless, I wonder if there is some language-thing going on here that I am
missing. Can it be a simple mistranslation (which inverts the meaning of the
saying!) that made its way into the other languages? If so, why did the
expression stick anyway? Does it appeal to some paradoxical mindset or
Straussian subtext?

**Interlude**: Five minutes pass, with me being annoyed that what I just wrote
does not feel right. Until I finally [look it up](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exception_that_proves_the_rule).

Here is the actual meaning: By pointing to an exception that is
explicitly part of the rule, the rest of the rule can be implied. Like a sign
that says "no parking from 9-5" would tell you that it is allowed the rest of
the time. Or the sign outside work saying "smoking allowed", thereby passive-aggressively
telling smokers to not do so anywhere else.

This make some sense. But as far as I remember, this is _not_ how the expression is commonly used.
The paradoxical meaning is dominant, in the context of real counter-examples. But
maybe I am wrong about that, too.
