From [this book review](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-wheres-my-flying):

Counterfactuals are fun! I think I dismissed them too quickly as unknowable for a long
time, but as with mot things, there can be better and worse arguments for how things could
have turned out differently.

The environemntal movement is an interesting case, because what is considered good or bad
in that context depends very much more on culture than on a problem solving strategy.
The underlying conviction that human activity is inherently destructive leads to
moralizing calls to give up things, that are not very effective.
Whereas the obvious alternative is to improve technology
to do more with less environmental impact. But that does not fit the narrative; 
to berate people and make them feel quilty lets one feel more morally 
superior and pure.

Would climate change never have become a problem, if the environmental movement
would have empraced nuclear power instead of crippling it? No one knows for sure, but
it certainly is interesting to think about.
