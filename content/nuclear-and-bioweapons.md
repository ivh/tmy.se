[This recent _80,000 hours_ podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/andy-weber-rendering-bioweapons-obsolete/)
is a great listen! Fascinating stories on how they secured nuclear material from former Soviet states, and a 
perspective on weapons of mass destruction that one does not hear very often.

Just a small excerpt:
>  North Korea has an advanced biological weapons program. What worries me about North Korea is they’re more likely to use biological weapons than nuclear weapons, because if they used a nuclear weapon, it’s over, right? If they used a biological weapon and delivered it covertly through secret operatives, anywhere in the world… In Malaysia, where they used VX against a Kim Jong-un’s brother in a successful assassination attempt. Now that was a chemical weapon, but wherever North Koreans have a diplomatic presence, they could launch biological weapons attacks covertly. And in a way, perhaps that’s a little bit deniable, maybe they would never get caught for doing it. So I think they’re more likely to do that than to use a nuclear weapon, which would have a home address.
