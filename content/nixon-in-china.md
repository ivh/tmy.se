Do you know the saying [_Only Nixon could go to China_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_goes_to_China)?
I didn't 'til just [now](http://blog.fefe.de/?ts=9e682bf2). It refers to the
[1972 visit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China) and as a metaphor
means that somebody (or an organization) that
has a reputation to strongly lean one way, has much more leeway to act in the opposite direction than
someone else.

A few examples that come to mind immediately:

* If a (European) Green Party would become pro-nuclear for climate-change reasons, after decades of
  opposition, they would immediately have more
  credibility than the parties that always have been for nuclear power. 
* It took the social-democrats to dismantle the western European welfare states. Similar attempts from
  the right would have been fodder for the next election.
* Super-rich people that want higher taxes.
* Were the Swedish Moderates, who opened up schools to the private market in the 90s, to admit that
  this was a bad idea, the perpetual stories about horrendous consequences might actually have something
  done about them.

Interestingly, politicians usually don't want to be "caught" changing their mind on some issue, which 
might not be the optimal strategy in light of the above.

And it should be very effective for someone
with an agenda to try joining the other side and change their stance from within; the low chances of
success might be outweighed by the larger impact in that case.
The episode of The West Wing about a gay Republican (in the early 2000s) fits that idea.

I think _Nixon in China_ is one of those mental models that is worth keeping in the back of one's mind for a while
and see how many more examples show up.
