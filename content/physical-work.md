Sometimes I wonder whether I made the wrong choice to get into academia. 
Now that I have been spending a few days [planting trees]({tag}forest) instead,
I get reminded once more that there is a sense of
satisfaction after a long day of physical work that has no real equivalent
in a desk job. The getting into a rhythm of repetition, the
sense of visible progress, and the feeling of relaxed exhaustion in the
evening. Something to be appreciated, for sure!

Then again, it might well be the case that the positive valence comes
purely from the contrast to everyday life. Probably I would
quickly get fed up, if I had to do boring physical work day in and
day out.
