"You lack ambition!" is an insult in some circles. I don't think
it has ever been hurled at me directly, but it would be quite true.
Meeting ambitious people who seem to know exactly what they want
to achieve are strange to me. How can they be so certain?
Havn't they just gotten stuck in an idea

Poetry is generally not for me but good prose that almost feels
like poetry I can get behind, for example _Ambition_
by David Whyte which begins like this:

> Ambition is a word that lacks any real ambition. Ambition is frozen desire,
> the current of a vocational life immobilized and over-concretized to set,
> unforgiving goals. Ambition abstracts us from the underlying elemental nature
> of the creative conversation while providing us the cover of a target that
> has become false through over description, overfamiliarity or too much
> understanding.
