This strikes a bit of a nerve for me. The second part I have always been bad at
and while I realized it late, at least I think I have understood it by now. Just
to give an example, my time as a PhD student would have gone soo much better
if I had gotten over my instinct "not to bother" my supervisor and collegues.
The whole thing with coming from a non-academic background probably plays into
this, but that's a topic for another time.

Knowing what to want is the more interesting question to me. It is easy to get stuck
in believing to want something, then this belief makes it true, in a self-fulfilling
way. There are many reasons why we want, and most of them we do not understand
ourselves, at least not very well, because even if we think we have good reasons,
the chance that they are a rationalization after the fact is quite high. (I am
currently re-reading _The Elephant in the Brain_ because of just that.)

There was a time when I envied poeple who knew what they wanted.  I think I
never really did myself. There are pros and cons to this. For example, keeping
the feeling of uncertainty alive made me getting used to and accept it.
This can contribute to the continued feeling of wonder about the world and
becoming more and more sceptical of people who are too certain of things.
Overall this fits nicely with the scientific mindset.

In addition, there is the whole idea of "wanting is suffering" in Eastern
philosophy. Being able to want less is a kind of superpower that not only
let's you get off the hedonic treadmill, but also cultivate a sense of gratitude
which is said to be a major factor in overall happiness. The Stoics were
right in this regard.

On the negative side, wanting less and not know what to want
can turn you into a drifter, not having an own
agenda and simply going along with the flow. Are you fine with others
ending up making decision for you instead? If you had more drive yourself, 
you might have a stronger sense of agency which contributes to life
satisfaction. But then again, if you know that the direction of your striving
is not really your own choice anyway, what's the point?
