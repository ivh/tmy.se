[Scott Sumner asks](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/while-america-and-europe-were-twiddling-their-thumbs/) whether Europe and America are
bungling the Coronavirus outbreak:

> Unlike the Chinese, we had several months to plan and then launch an all out effort to address the problem with very aggressive testing
> of the population to spot outbreaks. And yet both the US and Italian governments seemed unprepared for the outbreak when it finally occurred.

> If Europe and the US fall into recession we should not blame China. Indeed, many analysts expect the Chinese economy to be almost

Looking at the numbers seems to confirm this. China has [reduced its R0](https://twitter.com/GidMK/status/1236098031713497094) drastically
and S.Korea has made an [immense effort](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3065187/coronavirus-south-koreas-aggressive-testing-gives)
in testing 140.000 people, and their increase in deaths and news cases has slowed more than Italy's.

Meanwhile [the US mess up their testing](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597/)
and the Rest of Europe seems to be slow as well. Authorities still have the main message that all is under control and hesitate to
employ drastic measures. At least in Germany and Sweden where I follow the news.
