Is it possible to change your mind too much? I am generally trying to be actively aware of confirmation bias,
that is fitting every new bit of information into one's existing set of opinions. Plus I like the
feeling of novel thoughts and how they tickle your brain.

This sometimes manifests in an instinct to run in the opposite direction when everyone agrees on something.
Everyone thinks climate change will be catastrophic soon? Sure, but what about other solutions than admonishing
people to behave differently? And aren't some the activists claims exaggerated? (_Apocalypse Never_ by
Michael Shellenberger is a book that tries to distinguish the science from the hyperbole; I should finish it some day.)

That same gut reaction seems to be my default in many areas. If I wanted to flatter myself, I would call
it a "scientific mindset", to always question common wisdom, but I am not sure it really is that.
Also it becomes potentially "dangerous" socially,  in the sense that one can easily come across as obnoxious and 
unnecessarily crontrarian. And in the wrong context it can send the wrong signals as to
how one gets sorted into the bins labelled _good guy_ or _bad guy_.

Thus I am genuinely unsure whether I tend overcompensate when trying to correct my confirmation bias.
After all, there often are good reasons that there is a widely accepted view, and quickly throwing out a 
strong prior is bad [Bayesian thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55L7w2Vwkuk). In an extreme case,
it would make me gullible, accepting new arguments or framings without weighing them properly against what
I thought before.

Coincidentally, Scott Alexander [wrote about the exact opposite today](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/trapped-priors-as-a-basic-problem),
_trapped priors_. Quite likely I have some of these, too, and I see no immediate reason why one
cannot have too weak priors concerning one subject matter, and too strong ones in another.
