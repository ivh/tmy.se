[This presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjD1aLm4Thg) is quite
mind-blowing. The full title is *What Bodies Think About: Bioelectric
Computation Outside the Nervous System* and it shows almost incredible results

not neurons. Limb regeneration, double-headed worms, memory remaining after the
brain was cut off!
