Only a month ago I made my own [vibe-coded
hack]({filename}sharing-claude-code-sessions.md) to convert Claude Code
sessions to HTML. Now Simon Willison has [one-upped the
game](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/25/claude-code-transcripts/): Simply
run 
```bash
uvx claude-code-transcripts
```
and enjoy! [Here's an
example]({static}ai/dummyshare/index.html) of how I just asked Claude to tweak
the CSS of this site.

A [comment on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46375444) that made me smile:
> Frameworks abide by the Hollywood Principle and the Greyhound Principle:
> Don't call us, we'll call you.
> Leave the driving to us.

It's true! When using a framework one's code gets called by the framework and
it usually takes care of how things are run. This is from the discussion about
[Avoid Mini-Frameworks](https://laike9m.com/blog/avoid-mini-frameworks,171/),
an insightful article on unnecessary mid-level abstraction layers.


[How uv got so fast](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html) has
quite a few hallmarks of being (co-)written by AI, but I found it a good read
nonetheless. I continue to be impressed by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and
now use nothing else for running Python.
