I spent most of the day planting trees in the [forest]({tag}forest)
and I'll do the same tomorrow. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BvyvCLHzak)
(in Swedish) shows how it's done.


Three more YouTube-videos I enjoyed recently:

* [xkcd's "Map Projections", animated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O2CBgWshiM)
* [Duct tape space suit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdoMOXvqjbY)
* Robin Hanson [discusses his model of grabby aliens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24dJ9JlqL2A) with folks from FHI, including Nick Bostrom.
