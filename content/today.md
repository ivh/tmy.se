In my fresh attempt [to blog daily]({filename}consistency.md), today is the first time that I don't know what to write about. I am sure
this will happen frequently and getting over it is part of the point. Behaviours only become habits when you follow the rule.

I could tell you about that great podcast I just discovered, or the crappy film I watched last night, or 
I could show you a picture of where
in the forest I put up the [slaguggleholk]({filename}slaguggla.md) this morning. But I won't do that today. Instead I'll just 
ramble on for a while. Stream-of-consciousness writing they call it, I think. This term might be something my brain just made up on its
own but I won't look it up right now. If it isn't a real thing, it should be. James Joyce's _Ulysses_ comes to mind in this context,
but I might be wrong about that; I have never read it.

Damn, now I looked it up anyway: James Joyce's name had slipped my mind and of course Wikipedia tells you immediately that 
he is famous for [stream of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness), so there's that.

Talking about consciousness, I used to roll my eyes when someone tried to tell that there is a point to "subjective first-person experience" as 
compared to the "objective third-person" perspective. I'm not so sure about that anymore, not because I've gotten into new-agey woo-woo
kinds of things, but because it makes rational sense to me that there are things to learn about one's own mind by paying closer attention
to what it does minute-to-minute.

More about that at a later time. For today this will suffice for me to feel good about having blogged something. Not setting goals too high at the
outset of a new adventure is a good thing, they say. Whoever "they" are.
