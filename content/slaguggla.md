In November a [Ural owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_owl) visited our garden. This might not
be very spectacular, after all they are not that rare in middle and northern Sweden. 
But I had never seen
one before and was glad it stayed long enough for me to go get the camera.

It is commom knowledge here that Ural owls can get pissy during the spring when they have offspring. The
Swedish name for them is _slaguggla_ which literally means "the owl that hits you".

Nevertheless I just built a nesting box this morning, from some scrap material:

The cube of 30cm on all sides, plus a half roof, is meant to mimic a dead tree trunk that has
rotted away on the inside, leaving a cavity. My little book on animal shelters says this is
what Ural owls like to nest in. Now I only have to find a good spot in the forest and a way to put it up; it
is quite a bit larger and heavier than it looks in the picture.
