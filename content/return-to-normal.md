My [pandemic impatience]({filename}pandemic-thoughts.md) is not as bad anymore as it was a few
weeks ago. I am hearing of more and more people I know getting vaccinated and I am happy for them.
They should [restart their lives](https://www.econlib.org/fear-me-not-i-got-my-covid-vaccine/)
and not listen too much to those who revel in admonishing people to keep up with the precautions
as if the risk had not been drastically reduced.

[XKCD's comic on how the nRNA vaccine works](https://xkcd.com/2425/) is fantastic, by the way.
He has a whole series on the pandemic, all quite witty:
