Over Easter we visited Westflandern, the north-west corner of Belgium.
On short notice we did not manage to get into one of the historic breweries,
but high-tech in large and small scales sure was intersting as well:
[Kasteel](https://www.vanhonsebrouck.be/) and [Kazematten](http://www.kazematten.be/en).
