In November last year, two collegues and I happened to talk over lunch about
home-brewing beer and a few days later some packages with equipment arrived.
None of us had any real experience and I only vaguely remembered a good
podcast [(CRE 194, in German)](https://cre.fm/cre194-bier) about the subject.

So we read a few websites and ended up following the beginner's instructions at
[brauanleitung.de](http://www.brauanleitung.de). Our equipment is for the
standard homebrewer's batch size of ~20 l (5 gallons), meaning a big pot, two
plastic buckets, one for filtration, one for fermenting; a few hoses and
connectors, plus the actual ingredients for our batch #1: a single hop and
single (Pilsner) malt for a German-style "Alt", that is a light ale in the old
style, before Lagers became popular.

The result was good. Not the most amazing beer we had ever (partly becuase we
were imaptient and did not give it enough time from bottle fermentation to
drinking), but definitely good enough to continue! In the following, I will
link to the GoogleDocs that we used for keeping our log; they are in a varying
mix of the three languages (Swe/Ger/Eng) since we all know them to some degree
and gathered recipes and information in any language. But fellow brewers should
be possible to read the recipes anyway.

Our [#2 was an Irish Red
Ale](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pF_BIUEq_GO53TVvnLBR46v2IYgumLiUCdn5SCajkKo/edit?usp=sharing).
This was a big step up, following a proper recipe with four times as many
ingredients as our #1. We thought it would fit nicely as a Christmas beer, and
it sure did. Very malty, not much hops, almost sweet because of the liquid
yeast with lower attenuation.
