I finally read _The Call of Cthulhu_ the other day. Considering it's impact on culture this was
certainly overdue. I had read a collection of Lovecraft's short stories some year ago, but
this one was not among it for some reason. Needless to say it was a fun 

And while we're talking about monster stories, I also read H. G. Wells' _The War of the Worlds_

watched _The Thing_, 1982 Carpenter
