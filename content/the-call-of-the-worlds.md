I finally read _The Call of Cthulhu_ the other week. Considering it's 
[impact on culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu#Legacy), this was
certainly overdue. I had read a collection of Lovecraft's short stories some year ago, but
this one was not among them for some reason. Needless to say it was a fun read and the
quickly building atmosphere still works today.

And while at the topic of century-old monster stories, I also read H. G. Wells' _The War of the Worlds_
not long ago, with mixed feelings. It certainly has its moments and is propbably rightfully regarded as
one of the most important works in science-fiction. But I found it tedious at times and too long
for its own good, which is mostly due to its age, I guess.

Oh, one more monster: _The Thing_, the 1982 movie by John Carpenter, was quite entertaining! The
gory practical effects hold up well enough and the atmosphere is intense. I think I never had 
seen this to the end before; if I don't misremember I started watching it in my late teens, but
when it got to the scene in the dog cage I said "Nope! Not for me!" and turned it off
before the monster reveal.
