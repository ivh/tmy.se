The question I asked myself almost [three years ago](/new-laptop), what new laptop to get, finally got resolved a few weeks ago.
The old Thinkpad X230 still has not broken down, but I need to compile things at work more often nowadays, so a more modern machine made
sense.

Thus, after some more agonizing, I bought a *Dell Latitude 5401* with an Intel i7-9850H, 32Gb of RAM and a fast SSD. The not-tiny formfactor suits
me well and I like the larger screen. Skipping the Microsoft-tax by ordering it with Ubuntu pre-installed is a plus. So far it does its job well
enough and I do not regret the choice.
