ChatGPT is a mere three years old by now -- it sure feels longer. By now, many
seem to either have dismissed LLMs as useless (or evil) or have quickly taken
them for granted. But I continue to be amazed and find I get more and more
value from Claude et al.

What I probably like the most is that LLMs remove friction. What often slows us
down is not the lack of ideas or things to do and try, but the sum of the small
hurdles and hoops one has to jump though before getting anywhere.

Well, no more. Config problems with your web-app? Data needs to be converted to
or from an obscure custom format? Need to understand why your code does not do
what you think it should? Or understand someone else's code quickly? LLMs got
you covered. It's like
[rubberducking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) but the
duck talks back and can solve the entire problem for you!

Yes, they make mistakes and one may need to verify the results. But in may
cases this is trivial, or not really necessary, for example when discussing
different tools or solutions to a problem. Skimming through the alternatives
quickly lets one choose a path forward that is very likely better than it would
have been without asking the model.

This is an import aspect: having some taste and quick judgement helps a lot, in
other words *knowing what you want*.  If you really do, you probably are able
to explain it well enough to an LLM and get it to execute for you. If not, then
LLMs can help you too, but one needs to have enough clarity of mind to
recognize this as a different mode of operation, where non-leading questions
and iterations on the problem can improve one's thinking very much like a
discussion with a collegue or expert would have done.
