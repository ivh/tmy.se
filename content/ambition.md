Freedom in not being as ambitious as others. But there are negatives like envy.

"not being ambitious" is one of the stores we tell ourselves. they altogether make up our identity.
the story is not fully arbitrary, genes & experiences, but it is a stroy that can be changed.
the internal monologue and the things that we tell about orselves is malleable. It is not free-floating
from outside realities, but it is difficult to calibrate the picture of oneself with the picture
that others have.
