Fifteen years ago there was an [exciting paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1197258)
about bacteria that could use Arsenic instead of Phosphorous, which was thitherto thought
to be an essential ingredient to life and DNA.

I just watched [this fascinating interview](https://youtu.be/3FwLoYnuok8) with
one of the authors about the recent retraction of the paper - not because there
was misconduct or a major error, but because it turned out to be "likely wrong"
and "exaggerated" in the interpretation of the data.

I think the authors are right in protesting this new, impossible to meet, retroactive
standard. It is part of the scientific process to be wrong. Going back and retracting
parts of the history is counterproductive.

Much more info and nuance [in the interview](https://youtu.be/3FwLoYnuok8) - highly recommended!
