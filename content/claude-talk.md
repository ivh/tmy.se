On Monday I gave an informal presentation on how I use Claude Code (CC)to a
small group of collegues. [Here are the
slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zxMJKJKPIDtISNMJW3qq8oSYNefhri6aXKx5WUDHTck/edit?usp=sharing).
If you are a regular CC user, there will be little new for you in there.

Two metaphors are maybe worth mentioning, because my thoughts keep returning to them:

- *Siebenmeilenstiefel* or *seven-league-boots*, the magic boots from the fairy tale that let you *cover a lot of ground* quickly.
- *Morden* from *Babylon 5* asking *"What do you want?"*. He's the guy who shows up offering you exactly what you want, and the catch is you have to actually know what that is.

The latter is often the main sticky point, I think. Once you know well enough what
you want, you are able to ask for it and make CC let it magically appear. And
then have enough taste and understanding to judge the result.

But one has to answer the question for oneself first, which mostly means
breaking the larger goal down into concrete steps, or having enough
understanding of the code-base to have an opinion on the changes that CC
suggests  -  on a detailed conceptual level, not on a "typing"-level any more.
