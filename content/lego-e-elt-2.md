I built this last year from around 5500 Lego pieces. It's a model of the
furture European Extremely Large Telescope, to be erected n Chile during
the coming decade. The model design was made by Dutch astronomer Frans
Snik and you can read more about it and download the instructions and
parts list
[here](http://www.eso.org/public/sweden/announcements/ann14071/).

If you want to marvel at it up close, it is on display at the Astronomy
Department of Uppsala University. They have one in GÃ¶ttingen as well and
I guess there are several more around.
