Gender relations and corresponding statistics are a fascinating topic.

Difficult to _not_ take it personally when a statistic "shows something" about one's gender. But of course it doesn't mean
that an individual has a tendency toward the mean of the distribution. That men on average are taller than women and run
faster does mean nothing for the short fat bloke that struggles to walk up the stairs. We often make a difference between physical
and mental attributes 

For example, it turns out that the previous finding that women on average negotiate
a worse price [goes away](https://academic.oup.com/ej/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ej/ueab010/6141113)
if you control for the actual price of the property. In other words, men and women want different things.
