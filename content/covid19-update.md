I just started a continuously updated page at [/covid19]({filename}pages/covid19.md)

This graph plots the currently reported case-numbers of a few countries
on a logarithmic scale. I have applied a shift of a few days, see the legend,
to make the curves match up roughly.

I find remarkable that they can easily be made to line up, as soon as the numbers increase
above the noisy few.  
Now one could conclude from this that Italy is 4 days behind S.Korea in its outbreak, but
the numbers depend on how much testing each country does and S.Korea does a lot more than
most. Italy already has more deaths and its outbreak more likely has progressed further
than this graph would suggest,


What S.Korea is doing [seems to be working](https://twitter.com/yaneerbaryam/status/1235764321952632833).
This is good news because it shows that not only dictatorial countries can succeed with their
containment measures. Let's hope Europe learns quickly from this.

This is just a projection that among other things ignores differences in treatment capabilities.

[MIT takes the lead](http://web.mit.edu/covid19/) among the bis universities and suspends all foreign
travel and meetings until mid-May.

A short [interview with Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNxAmRAYagQ) who, as 
usual, has interesting things to say.
