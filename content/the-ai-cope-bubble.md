There are very few things that I miss from not actively following Twitter anymore, but
Anders Sandberg's posts are certainly among them.
Luckily, he [runs a blog](http://aleph.se/andart2/personal/a-somewhat-delayed-annual-review/)
too.

[Quoting him](https://bsky.app/profile/arenamontanus.bsky.social/post/3lqfd6fmji223) on
the *cope bubble*, that is the opposite of the hype bubble:

> I often find people unable to comprehend that there can be a simultaneous hype bubble and real progress. But the cope bubble is more insidious: it is not telling you that people are full of misleading hype, but that there is nothing there. Hence no need to critically look for information, no interest in disconfirmation.

Where on [this plot surface](https://bsky.app/profile/arenamontanus.bsky.social/post/3lqfd6h7n7s23)
do you find yourself?
