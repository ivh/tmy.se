This post is back-dated a few hours. Yes, I broke the blogging streak, but I have a good excuse: I watched
[_Druk_ (Another Round)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Round_(film)) last night, a recent film
with Mads Mikkelsen.

The plot is quickly summarized. Four teachers decide to test a psychologist's 
([apparently real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_Sk%C3%A5rderud))
claim, that humans are born with blood alcohol level 0.5â€° too low and that one would perform better
professionally and socially after correcting this deficiency. The experiment predictably goes well, until it doesn't.

Overall predictability is not a negative here though, it builds to a dreadful anticipation. The four protagonists
go off the rails in different rails as they increasingly perform the reasons to do it in the first place, a
combination of boredom, existential angst and feeling lost in marriage.

The film's performances are great, the characters relatable and the ending is ecstatic and highly ambiguous. Recommended!

_Addendum:_ I only now read that, by sheer coincidence, _Druk_ won the Oscar for best international film the same night
that I watched it. Nice.
