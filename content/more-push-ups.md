An updated plot of push-up statistics:

I had some problems with my wrists last week, so I had to take a bit of a break. But this
has resolved itself and slow progress is being made again. Doing 25 push-ups in a row
is already more than I was ever able to, I think.

The thing with the wrists is kinda funny. Whenever I start a new exercise, something
unexpected, other than the training goal itself, becomes the limiting factor for a while.
This was very clear when I started running; at some point it was the shins, then the
calves, or the knee, once even the bones in the foot's arch. My way of handling it
is always the same: take it easy, don't push through it. Try to improve form, that is
try to figure out if you're doing it wrong. After a while the body adapts and the next
thing becomes the limit. Repeat.
