A parcel with early presents for ourselves arrived yesterday, 
extending our small collection of board games with Takenoko and Codenames.
I was happy to note that they come in Swedish versions, which 
in the case of Takenoko only matters for the manual, while Codenames is
much more language-specific.

Both games are already well-known and luckily I still know a few game-enthusiasts
back in Germany with whom I had the chance to test-play earlier this year.
Codenames got the prestigeous award "Spiel des Jahres" in the meantime,
guaranteeing even greater success.
