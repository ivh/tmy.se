> suppose you at- tended two lectures, back-to-back, by two equally con- vincing
experts — the first discussing insurmountable difficulties of relativistic
space flight, and the second dis- cussing the resources available to a
technologically ma- ture civilization.  Emerging from the lecture hall, you
find yourself con- flicted, splitting your credence equally between two views
of the universe. One in which the maximum practi- cal expansion speed of an
ambitious civilization is about v = .1, and in the other view somewhere around
v = .9.  Then, invoking the SIA together with the possibility of expanding
civilizations implies you should be 99.9% con- vinced of the low-speed scenario
(because it leaves room for ≈ 1,000 times as many human-stage civilizations to
have originated at the present time).  That is, until you return to your day
job of analyzing millions of unsurprising galaxy spectra. If your survey data
is sufficiently deep and detailed, and it covers, say, 30% of the sky, you
might return to the conclusion that the low-speed scenario is only about a 73%
favorite after all.
