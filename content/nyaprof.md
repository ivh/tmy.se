![Cover image and text]({photo}nyaprof.jpg)

Uppsala university recently published this Festschrift that lists all newly installed professors. As cover they chose 
an image that made me stop short: a single male surrounded by a flock of females. Not exactly what one would
expect in usually quite gender-aware Swedish academia. It gets worse once you read the description
that enlightens us that there is indeed only one professor in the picture, the man. And that the others are a "group
of women from the Orient". Oh, dear!

However, I think there is a way to read all this sympathetically. The caption tells us further that the
chaired professorship held by the man in the image is about semitic languages, which explains the connection to 
"oriental women" shortly after the second world war. Also, this chair is one of the positions newly filled
by a women included in the booklet. So, benevolently, the message of the cover image can be read as "Look
at how things were a few decades ago, and look inside for how much more equal they are today."
