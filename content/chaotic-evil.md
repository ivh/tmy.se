Let's ignore the direct effects of the transatlantic buffoon-in-chief for a
moment; these are discussed quite enough already. I think there are two
competing _secondary_ effects that he has on the attitudes of people elsewhere,
one good one bad.

First the positive: A clear enemy helps unification. Very visible right now is
the common outcry of otherwise not united groups and individuals about the USA
leaving the Paris climate treaty. There are plenty more examples and making fun
of the Orange one is a favourite pastime for many.

But. It is all too easy to feel good about ourselves doing this. We are lucky
to live elsewhere and not be affected. Our politicians seem competent in
comparison and it suddenly looks like we don't have it that bad after all.  Is
it then a surprise that Merkel will win the German elections later this year?
Or that recently unloved Swedish prime-minister Löfvén has turned around the
polls for his social democrats?

It is perfectly understandable to become complacent when others have it worse.
How content we humans are always depends on whom we compare ourselves to.
Observing the quagmire "over there" means we relax the pressure on our own
polticians to fix the problems in our countries, which have not magically gone
away. Just to name one, do we have a plan to do something about the constantly
rising wealth gap that is expected to only get worse with further increases in
work automation?

Which way the net balance between stonger unity behind good causes and lowered
expectations tips, I do not know.
