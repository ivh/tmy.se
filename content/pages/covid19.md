This page is about COVID19, i.e. the disease caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. I am
not an expert in the field, but have been following developments closely since early February
and feel the need to collect some information. No guarantees about being correct and no need
to trust me on anything; what I found enlightening myself might work for you, or not.

The graph of deceased in the ten countries or regions with the highest numbers looks like this:

Note that this is a logarithmic plot. Currently it looks like the increase in China has slowed down,
while Italy and Iran are the most worrying.ยง

There are several scientists and journalists that do an outstanding job communicating on Twtter.

Current best estimates on the basic parameter of the disease:

* doubling time [link](https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/current-patterns-transmission/global-time-varying-transmission.html)
* 0.5% IFR, 1% CFR [link](https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1235700941422198787) [link](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3065187/coronavirus-south-koreas-aggressive-testing-gives)
* 10% ICU in Italy
* ... work in progress

CFR means every death means 100 cases, yet discovered or not. Since people do not die immediately, but after two weeks, this means a
death today means 400 cases today. So the 100 deaths each in S.Korea and Italy would mean 40000 infected. Even if this is an overestimate,
if the order of magnitude is right, then that means many undetected cases, especially in Italy.

Spreading out the outbreak over time [helps](https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1235761684431724550).
