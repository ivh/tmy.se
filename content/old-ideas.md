[This interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-moynihan-prior-generations/)
is extremely fun to listen to. They discuss historic views of how people thought the
world worked, and how that got changed over the centures. Lots of fun and wacky
ideas, like fossils being rock that tries to become animal!

And the meta-question:

> When you’re studying the way that people very far in the past conceived of

> encounter ideas that seem very misguided, kind of batty from our modern point
> of view. And I think people go in different directions in their aesthetic
> about how to react to this. Like one strain of thought is that this just
> shows how hard it is for humans to reason at all. It shows the fallibility of
> our ability to make sense of the world. And so it should make us extremely
> humble, and we shouldn’t dismiss the way that they thought about things
> because we will probably be just as mistaken as they were by the lights of
> people in the future.

I am with Rob here, in that we should not have false humility and assume that
we are as wrong as our ancestors. We clearly have made progress and can
explain the world better than ever before today.
