In recent months I've been cutting down on my following the
news cycle and social media, and on some podcasts. This has
freed up time for some books to read or listen to. Here
are a few that I enjoyed quite a bit.

* _The Gene: An Intimate History_ by Mukherjee, Siddhartha.
* _Sapiens_ and _Homo Deus_ by Yuval Noah Harari.
* _Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body_ by Daniel Goleman & Richard Davidson.
* If you are as skeptical toward "meditation" as I was, Sam Harris' _Waking Up_ might convince you that it can be done without religious mumbo-jumbo.
* _The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World_ by David Deutsch. 
* _I Contain Multitudes: The Microbes Within Us and a Grander View of Life_ by Ed Yong.
* Last, [_Compelling Science Fiction_](http://compellingsciencefiction.com/) periodically publishes ebooks with short stories. Not all brilliant, maybe, but some quite compelling indeed.
