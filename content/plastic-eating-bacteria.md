I was wondering the other week why plastic-eating bacteria havn't

adaptation and an energy-rich resource lying around, floating in the
oceans and being a pollution problem should be a golden opportunity.

Obviously I am missing something here because of my ignorance in
biology. But people seem to be working on it:
