I might still write these up in more detail here, but I've
been documenting some of my recent beers in the German
homebrewers forum already, with lots of pictures.
So if you are interested in this kind of thing, head over there for my [Fruit &
Sour Beers](https://hobbybrauer.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=21199) and the
[Norwegian Råøl](https://hobbybrauer.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=22803).  The
corresponding recipe for the latter is also available
[here](https://www.maischemalzundmehr.de/index.php?id=1202&inhaltmitte=rezept)
and I uploaded another one for a [White IPA with
Kveik](https://www.maischemalzundmehr.de/index.php?id=1195&inhaltmitte=rezept).

I have been brewing several more beers with different
[Kveik](http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/farmhouse/kveik.html) strains and
very much like the fact that they can be dried and thus stored for a [long
time](http://suigenerisbrewing.com/index.php/2019/08/28/drying-kveik-the-grand-finale/)
before using them again.
