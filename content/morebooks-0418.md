In my [recent list](/books) I omitted the two that I have not finished yet. But even so, I am more than half-way through both
and will most likely not find the remainders less excellent.

* Richard Dawkins' _Selfish Gene_ is of course a famous book; and now even I know why. How selection pressure can steer behaviour in animals (us humans not excluded) is truly enlightening. I especially liked that the author co-reads the audio-version himself, which makes his included later commentary on the over 40 years old text extra entertaining.
* _The Elephant in the Brain_ is written by Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson and was released earlier this year. It is about how unaware we are about our actual motivations. We deceive ourselves to get away with selfish acts while at the same looking good and noble in our own eyes, and hopefully those of others.

I cannot put it into words yet how but the two books are very much related to each other. I mean in a deeper sense than that they are about behaviour.
