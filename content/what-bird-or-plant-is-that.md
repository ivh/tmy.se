Have you heard of [PlantNet](https://identify.plantnet.org/)
and [BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/)?
Their phone apps allow you to take a picture of a flow or plant, or record bird song, and 
instantly get an answer on what species it is. 

They are not perfectly
accurate and often give several probable choices, but very impressive and
fun nonetheless. I especially like the visualization of the spectrum of bird songs,
because I remember more easily how they look than from sound alone.
