I have never been good at doing push-ups. Upper body strength in general
has never been my thing and I have always preferred low- to medium-intensity
exercise, endurance like running.

However, I recently had the idea to change that and I remembered that logging progress
helped me more than ten years ago to get into running. Even though I no longer do that 
(I wear my old GPS clock as a watch, but never turn it on when I go running),
keeping tabs might just work as a motivation-hack once more. For added effect, I hereby make this
commitment public, which is something that I hear people claim also keeps you from
abandoning the routine.

Thus, here is the plot of max and median set sizes, and total number of push-ups every
day, for the last ten days:

I will occasionally post a plot like this with updated numbers.
The script that makes the plot is [here]({static}puplot.py.txt).
