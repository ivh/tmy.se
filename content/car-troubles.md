Last spring, during one of our [long
drives]({filename}brussels-uppsala-by-car.md) I was stupid enough to bump into
the car in front of us, at low speed. Luckily, there was not much damage, but
our car's front was compressed a centimeter or two, such that the left headlight
no longer was properly attached.

Since it's an older car and not the kind of damage that affected operation, I
just let it be and did nothing much. But now it was time for an inspection so I
had another look yesterday. After thinking for a few minutes, I found a spot on
the light casing that could hold a screw, such that it works as an attachment
for a strong zip tie. This, in turn, now pulls the light into place and secures
it. I love zip ties.

This morning, the car (2009 Toyota Yaris) passed the inspection with flying
colours - yay! Now it is ready to be sold. The replacement will be a Nissan Note,
which is the right compromise between a city-traffic and long trips, that our
[electric]({filename}leffe.md) is not meant for.
