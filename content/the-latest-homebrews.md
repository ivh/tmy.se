It's been over a year since I [last wrote]({filename}/erlenstarter.md) about
homebrewing. Well, I guess I was rather doing it than talking about it. The
number of batches has been steadily increasing, the latest #35 being a reddish
Pale Ale with lots of Ekuanot hops. Overall I've been following a traditional
approach in beer styles per season, meaning that I brewed a few lagers last
winter (Helles, Dunkles and a very good strong Schwarzbier), some wheat beers
in summer (both Bavarian and Belgian Wit), and Pale Ales and Stouts in between.
The clones of the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and of the Chimay Red Belgian Dubbel
came out very nicely.
