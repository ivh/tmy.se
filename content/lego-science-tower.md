Last night I finally finished buil:ding my Lego Science Tower. The set is not official but originates from
a [crowd-funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJBhOAIyWZU) effort by Bricklink.
The sealed box had been sitting in my office for
two years until I recently brought it home to have some fun with it.

You can see Newton's apple in the tree and Mendel's garden in front of the tower. The telescope on the
top rotates and tilts by turning the knobs. [Inside]({static}pic/scitow-inside.jpg) there is Pawlov's
dog, Schr√∂dinger's cat, a library and a chemistry lab, among other things. Overall a lovely design
with ingenious attention to detail!
