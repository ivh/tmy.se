I've recently been reading Nick Bostrom's book
*Superintelligence* and must admit it stuck with me. It may
well seem a tad abstract to us who are new to thinking about
such matters, but highly stimulating and thought-provoking.

The main point is driven home thoroughly: We should be talking
more about artificial intelligence! Because its arrival might
be just around the corner and it has the potential to mark a
crossroads for our future, the choices being really really bad
or really really fantastically good.

If you havn't read them yet, these two blog posts by Wait But Why are probably the best introdution: [Part 1](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/07/the-sugar-conspiracy-robert-lustig-john-yudkin), [Part 2](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html).

I am currently half-way through Olle Häggström's *Here Be Dragons* which covers related but broader toptics of near-future technologies.
