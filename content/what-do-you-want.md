Quoting [Sinom Willison](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/24/dont-trust-the-process/):

I had a similar thought the other day. Now that code just
magically appears when you ask for it, you better ask for the right things.
That includes several aspects, like the background knowledge to know what is
feasable, the taste in judging the choices that the AI makes, and the general direction
where you you are headed.

In other words: *Knowing what you want.*
And that is a tricky question, as all 90s kids know.

[Claude agrees]({static}/pic/claudeonmorden.png) this is a good metaphor for AI, but points out that the shadows used the question to actively sow chaos, while LLMs are more neutral.
