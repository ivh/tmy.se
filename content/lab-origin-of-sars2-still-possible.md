I am as quick in dismissing anything that sounds like a conspiracy theory
as anyone. But I also recognize that the perceived consensus is oftentimes
just that, perceived.

This is also true for science. While we often claim that everybody tries
to disprove everyone else to gain recognition, the reverse is more often
true. Going againt the mainstream opinion is costly, it damages reputations
and funding; after all it is others in the same field who get to decide what
is good science, and what is bad.

Which brings me to [this article, which argues that a lab origin of the COVID virus 
it is not as unlikely as generally believed](
https://nicholaswade.medium.com/origin-of-covid-following-the-clues-6f03564c038).
The author shows that the pieces that very much shaped the consensus are not
very convincing, that virologists know this but have no strong incentives
to make this opinion heard. That the lab-origin claim is 
associated with Trump does not help.

As a layman I have no strong opinion on this, of course. But dismissing any
possible origin of the Coronavirus out of hand does not sound right to me.
Needs more research!
