Call me old-fashioned. but I prefer RSS-feeds to any other
way of reading the web. An open, de-centralized and
automatic way of gathering the latest things from various
sources, and presenting them in a consistent, ad-free and
readable formatting of my own choice, without generating
a shit-load of metadata for some platform - what more is there
to want?

In recent years, I've been running [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/)
on a small rented v-server and it does the job. There is an
[App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fox.ttrss) 
as well.

The one area where RSS has not fallen out of fashion yet, are podcasts.  I sure
hope that the diverse landscape of content and players (I use
[DoggCatcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snoggdoggler.android.applications.doggcatcher.v1_0))
does not fall prey to the lures of platformization any time soon.
