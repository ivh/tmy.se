Ever since we moved into our cottage in the forest, there was a small wodden deck in front of the rock wall that limits the property.
It is a sunny spot and the rock stores some warmth, so we naturally like to hang out in the garden furniture there. Unfortunately, the deck
itself had rotted so much by now that one  started to step through the boards.

I had put a temporary fix in place and thought I'd do the proper renovation early next year. But in a bout of restlessness
I tore it all down the other week and started over from scratch. And I mean _from scratch_, starting by cutting some timber
into beams and boards. This a manual process using the chainsaw and some improvised rigs to ensure straight cuts.

Having good foundations is imporant, even for such simple construnctions as a 4.5x3m deck. So I put some heavy granite stones
into the corners, drilled holes and glued in some hardware with anchoring adhesive. In one corner the rock wall itself stuck out
underneath,
so could drill straight into the rock - this thing is going nowhere!

Then I put together the frame and oiled it with a traditional mix of tar and linseed oil. In the picture you can see that I had to
put in four additional trusses (the yet unpainted ones) because I originally had far too large spacing.

Even though the surface is not very large, cutting all the boards out of tree trunks and straightening the edges with a circular saw
took quite a while. Once I had screwed them on, I did not have the energy to think of any advanced stair construction,
so it turned out as simple as possible. Still, I am quite happy with how the whole thing turned out:

I recycled the old railing which was in ok shape, just painted it and screwed it onto some feet, so it will be easily replaced, if needed.
