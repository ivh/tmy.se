I'm listening through the back-log of Sam Harris' podcast for a while
and today it was time for [Episode #71 on the fight for time and
attention](https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/what-is-technology-doing-to-us),
which I found very enlightening.

We've all had mixed feelings about social media and other technologies that are
optimized to gain and keep our attention, so I found it helpful to
get some vocabulary for thinking better about this topic. I won't
summarize it here, go listen to it!

If not, then one take-away message certainly is:
> Technology is not neutral!
