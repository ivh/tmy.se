A random set of internet gems that I enjoyed recently.

Let's start with the Coronavirus COVID19. Three Twitterers that seem to
knowledgable, up-to-date and not hyping-up matters are
[Kai Kupferschmidt](https://twitter.com/kakape)
[Helen Branswell](https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell)
and [Ian M Mackay](https://twitter.com/MackayIM). Plus,
there are [good]() [articles](https://virologydownunder.com/so-you-think-youve-about-to-be-in-a-pandemic/)
coming from down under.

[Don't bury the lede](https://billwadge.wordpress.com/2020/02/10/im-good-enough-im-smart-enough-and-dog-gone-it-people-like-me-writing-grant-applications/),
not even in grant applications.

[The International Space Station in LEGO](http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-012120a-lego-international-space-station.html).
I like that this is an official set, not a custom design or one-off sale. Speaking of which: My 
[Science Tower](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/build/afoldesigner_winner_model.page?id=59446) is still waiting to be built.

[Quit the news! (PDF)](https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf) It's bad for you!

Robin Hanson [comapares Parasite and Joker](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/01/parasite-versus-joker.html). This made me
think less of Parasite and want to watch Joker. I have downloaded it, but not gotten around to it yet.
