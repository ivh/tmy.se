> Imagine what would happen if we had a magic wand that could solve climate change. Should we wave it?

Apparently, most people answer no.

Recommended 45 minutes to listen! Transcript available.


I agree with most of what they say, and like the idea of the new movement of _ecomodernism_. 
Finding pragmatic solutions to environmental problems and

Lynas' story about how he helped banning GMO in Europe and how he now thinks this was a mistake is a
harrowing example of doing great harm with good intentions. I get chills when I imagine having to
live with that. Luckily, I have never been sure enough about anything to become an activist.
