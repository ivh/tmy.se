At the gym earlier today I listen to the [latest episode of Very Bad
Wizards](https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/153). I was slightly disapppointed
that neither of them knew what a Klein bottle is, but I liked the update on the
replication crisis in psychology (from 42:30 onward).

While I certainly approve of drunk podcasting, the converstation between Tamler
and his [step-mother](https://twitter.com/chsommers) was a bit too inhoherent.
The portrayed craziness on US campuses seems quite remote from a Swedish
perspective, but usually Europe just lags behind and soon follows suit...
