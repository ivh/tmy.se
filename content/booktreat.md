It's not often that I treat myself with a fresh order of books  -  I've been
consuming more ebooks and audiobooks lately. But after I finished Harari's
fantastic _Sapiens_, I wanted the successor _Homo Deus_ right away. If you
havn't heard of the former, I can highly recommend it! It's a critical
look at our species, from a more unbiased perspective than we are used to.

Then there is _Medieval Uppland_, a book that will hopefully give us some
inspiration for summer excursions nearby. Last, _How To Brew_ is the
just-out new edition of what seems to be the homebrewers' bible. After skimming
through it, there sure is enough detail to satisfy the needs of
not-so-novice-anymore brewers. I'm currently waiting for my 11th batch to
finish fermenting.
