When I encounter [news like this](https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/leaf-coalition-introduction/)
I cannot help but think of [Greenwashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing).
Giant corporations like Unilever and
Nestl√© committing a billion dollars to protect tropical forests can sound like buying a way out
of bad press.

But then I tell myself to be less cynical and appreciate that these organizations have a huge lever
to do less of [_wrong thing_] and more of [_right thing_] and that we do indeed want them to be incentivized
in that direction. Being suspicious enough to dismiss any positive initiatives as marketing ploy, does the
opposite. It makes everyone less likely to get out of the bad equilibrium of unsustainable exploitation on the one hand,
and righteous environmentalists scolding them on the other.

So, kudos to everyone behind the
[LEAF coalition](

May you have a good plan for achieving the most good with the money.
