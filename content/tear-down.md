I think my first outside project for the spring and summer is taking shape
in my head: a shed extension to move the [home brewery]({tag}homebrewing)
out of the kitchen and wardrobe.

The first step is, as so often, to make thing worse, before they bet better. Yesterday
I tore down the the small firewood shed ([before-picture]({static}/pic/shed_before.jpg))
after having emptied it in recently.

The area there measures about 3 by 4 metres which should be plenty for my rather modest
brewing equipment, even if I decide to expand it somewhat.

But first I'll have to finish the removal of large rocks that are in the way. I started
this more than a year ago, but granite is hard and heavy, slowing down the drilling and
driving of wedges. Lifting the remaining pieces out of the way is good deadlift exercise
though!
