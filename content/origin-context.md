I still listen to the excellent [podcast with German virologist Christian Drosten](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Coronavirus-Update-Der-Podcast-mit-Christian-Drosten-Sandra-Ciesek,podcastcoronavirus100.html)
and in the latest episode
[(transcript)](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/coronaskript302.pdf),
he puts the recent media attention for the [lab leak hypothesis]({filename}lab-origin-of-sars2-still-possible.md)
into context.

Lots of intersting bits of information there!
I tried to run some paragraphs through automatic translations, but the result did not do it justice. So
brush up your German, if you know some, and do listen or read!
