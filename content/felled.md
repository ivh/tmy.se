I spent the morning felling another four trees that were taken over by [bark beetles]({filename}barkborre.md).
In order to prevent the larvae from developping into bugs and then spreading to neighbouring trees, one has to
remove all the bark from the tree. 
This quite tedious but it helps to have a [really sharp knife](https://www.gransforsbruk.com/produkt/gransfors-bandkniv/)
that is designed for that purpose.
