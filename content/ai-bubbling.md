I fully agree and get lots of value from my 20$ Claude subscription, mostly via [ClaudeCode](https://claude.com/product/claude-code). More on that later, but I am happy to take investors' money by buying a product that is sold under break-even price. May it last as long as possible. But to continue the quote:
