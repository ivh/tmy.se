I just made a big overhaul of this site. Although there is a new theme in
place as well, the biggest changes are under the hood: no more Wordpress,
but static html-files generated with [Pelican](http://getpelican.com).

In addition, the webserver [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) is no longer only
responsible for SSL and HTTPS while proxying to Nginx, but now serves the site directly.

New URLs are without dates, but old ones should still work fine. If you happen to see anything broken, feel free to drop me an email.
