I have long enjoyed the writings of Robin Hanson, but while I followed the [beginnings of his focus
on *cultural drift*](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/our-big-oops), he has lost me since, to the point where I mostly skip his blog posts when they show up in my RSS reader.

So I did the natural thing and asked Claude to [catch me up, then critique the
arguments, and then to channel the man himself for a
rebuttal](https://claude.ai/share/a45b1667-f463-4736-b121-1bb1fb6bc3a9).
Obviously, Robin might disagree with this characterization, but I found it the right level of "dumbed down" for myself, and far from AI slop.
