We own a small patch of forest and had to take down a piece of it because of the bark beetle outbreak that has been
causing large problems in recent years. So now it is time to make sure that the new generation of trees
gets off ot a good start there.

While we're waiting for a delivery of 4000 saplings, I spent the morning to plant the ones that we grew
ourselves in the garden last year. They promise rain for tomorrow.
