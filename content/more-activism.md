I was again [planting forest]({tag}forest) today and I listen to podcasts while doing that.
As a nice follow-up to [yesterday]({filename}ecomodernism.md), I very much enjoyed
[this one about ending factory farming for chickens](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/leah-garces-chicken-industry/).

Many insights into when it makes sense to antagonize and campaign against the people doing the things
you consider bad, versus working *with* them to improve the situation. In this example, chicken farmers
in the US are often stuck in a bad system that they do not approve of themselves, which opens the door
for win-win situations.

Overall another great interview by [@robertwiblin](https://twitter.com/robertwiblin)!
