Today is one of those days that make it hard to write even a single line. I had several attempts 
during the morning but found my mind to be too preoccupied with other things, from work
to all kinds of nonsense, to even think of something I could attempt.

This is however exactly why I try to [keep the habit]({filename}consistency.md), no matter what.
Getting over the threshold and putting out these few words will lower the hurdle in the long
run. At least that is the hope and I have to remind myself because today it does not feel like
it works. Oh well.


Apropos preoccupations, observing how little control one generally has over
what the own mind occupies itself with, is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the
one hand, noticing and admitting this fact must certainly be the first step towards changing
something, or even decide if change is desirable.
On the other hand, even after a small amount of practice in meta-awareness, it
is laughable how easy it is for certain thoughts to take over awareness and jerk it around.
I blame the [default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network).
