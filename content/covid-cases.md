Since I just [tweeted it](https://twitter.com/ivh/status/1236307770678358021), I might as well put up this
plot here as well:
[![covid-cases]({photo}covid-cases.jpg "covid-cases")]({static}/pic/covid-cases.jpg)

It shows the latest reported number of COVID19 cases outside China, on a logarithmic scale. If you are
not used to this, just know that the curve steepness corresponds to the growth rate of cases,
or if you will the doubling time. The steeper the curve, the shorter the time it
takes get double the number of cases.

There are several noteworthy things here, I believe. First off, like the [last post]({filename}are-we-messing-this-up.md) claimed, S.Korea
has managed to flatten the curve more than any European country. Only Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan seem to do even better, but they have
a far weaker outbreak for now.
