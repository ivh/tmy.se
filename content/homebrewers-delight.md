No better way to spend a rainy Sunday than to make full use of the kitchen. Bottling the last batch of beer and brewing a
new (split) batch takes the better part of the day, but everything went smooth today and I was done by 4pm, including
the cleaning of all equipent and the kitchen itself.

I was reusing the yeast from [last week]({filename}wheat-beer.md), this time for a Pale Ale with lots of 
fruity hops: Simcoe, Mosaic, Citra, you name it. And part of the batch became a single-hop with HBC 692 which I
had not used before.
