I like to fix things when they break, and also to use them until they really no longer work.
Replacing something that does its job, just because there exists a "nicer" version of it
out in the world, is an itch that I am able to resist scratching most of the time. The 
aesthetics of objects has value, but I generally rank it lower than the enviromental
impact of consumerism and the hassle to buy things. Deciding what to get and then doing so
is effort that has to be priced in.

All that is to say that I broke our coffee pot when I took it out of the dishwasher yesterday.
