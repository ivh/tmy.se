I had seen [her TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/julia_galef_why_you_think_you_re_right_even_if_you_re_wrong)
before and had noticed her name pop up in my timeline on Twitter from time to time. But I admit I did not
really have **Julia Galef**'s work on my radar until recently, when I added [her podcast](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/)
to my rotation. So far it has been very good and I intend to check-out the large backlog eventually.

But first, I'll dive into the book that she just released:
[The Scout Mindset](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/555240/the-scout-mindset-by-julia-galef/).
See [her Twitter](https://twitter.com/juliagalef) for teasers, or listen to her being interviewed
about it [here](https://clearerthinkingpodcast.com/?ep=036).

I did not mention it in my [Star Trek rewatch]({filename}star-trek-the-movies.md), but Julia is certainly right that
[Spock is not very logical](https://www.wired.com/2021/04/geeks-guide-spock-logic/), and quite annoying.

_P.S._: See her explain Scout Mindset through activist examples in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzkWqpsPqho).
