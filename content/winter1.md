We have had quite the winter here in Uppsala, Sweden. Many days my
exercise was replaced by shovelling snow. It never became too much
to cause real problems and we made it through the stretch of cold
by emptying the firewood sheds.

Now all snow has melted already, but we are in that frustrating period
called _v√•rvinter_ (spring-winter) where everything is gray and ugly, snow
and wet take turns, until spring finally comes at the beginning
of May.
