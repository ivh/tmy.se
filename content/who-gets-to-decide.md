Once more concerning the lab leak hypothesis for the origin of COVID19, I thought aloud the other day:

In a similar vein, but more pithy, I saw a tweet that I cannot seem to find any more, but was close to:

> Letting scientists that work on gain-of-function research decide whether or not it is worth the risk
> is like letting the oil industry decide over climate change policy.

While I would not put it as strongly myself, I think the point is valid. The stakes are too
high and eventualities too hard to judge for individual research groups or even funding agencies.

Which is why I am happy to note that this kind of discussion is being had within the field, an example being
[this conversation](https://anchor.fm/lea-degen/episodes/6---Securing-Good-Futures-for-Biotech-with-Tessa-Alexanian-e12r0d3).
