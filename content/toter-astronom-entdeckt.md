Im hiesigen Dom wird gerade für eine neue Orgel ein wenig umgebaut.
Dabei hat man unter dem Boden eine bislang unbekannte Grabkammer
[entdeckt](http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/uppland/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=1433895).
Es wird vermutet, dass es sich um Anders Spole und seine Familie
handelt, die im 17. Jahrhundert lebten.

Zu Anders Spole kann ich meinen Brötchengeber
[zitieren](http://www.astro.uu.se/history/spole.html), denn Spole war
der “erste richtige Astronom in Uppsala” und außerdem der Großvater von
[Anders
Celsius](http://www.fiket.de/2007/05/23/celsius-linne-und-die-temperaturskala/):

> Spole studied mainly at the german Greifswald University, where he
> received his degree, also including military arts and navigation. He
> made his “grand tour”, around Europe, in the years 1664-1667 where he
> met such men as Huygens, Hooke, Boyle, Mercator, Boullieau, Cassini
> and Riccioli. He was called as professor in astronomy when Lund
> University was founded and later became professor at Uppsala
> University in 1679.  
>  He was a succesful teacher, he also published his own text-books, and
> presided at around 50 disputations. Spole was a competent instrument
> maker and built an observatory on the top of his house in the centre
> of Uppsala which, however, was completely destroyed together with his
> instruments and papers in the great city fire of 1702. He observed the
> great comet of 1680, where he could observe dust lanes in the tail,
> and sunspots, which he regarded as the origins of comets. He also made
> many geographical observations for the Swedish General Map.
