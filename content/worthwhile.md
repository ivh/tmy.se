A few things I just read, watched or listened to, and found well worth the time.

[Arsenic and Old Lace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic_and_Old_Lace_(film)), a 1944 dark comedy with Cary Grant.

[A Blogging Style Guide](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/06/a-blogging-style-guide/), entertaining.

I still recommend you go read Simler & Hanson's *Elephant in the Brain*. [Another review](http://msls.net/2018/08/16/the-elephant-in-the-brain/).

Scott Alexander [reviews a book about the mind](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/11/28/book-review-the-mind-illuminated/) and points me toward [Global Workspace Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_workspace_theory), which makes quite a bit of intuitive sense to me.

The latest [Sam Harris with Deeyah
Khan](https://samharris.org/podcasts/144-conquering-hate/) is definitely one of
his best conversations to date. On how neo-nazis and jihadists are similar, and how we
need to do better in treating them, among other things.

[Does money make you mean?](https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_piff_does_money_make_you_mean) Yes, it does.

[Gollum Brexit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tjp5OmoDYQM). Brilliant!
