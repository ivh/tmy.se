I usually don't consider myself a "fan" of anything, but when it comes to the
work of [@MaxCRoser](https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser) at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/), and
[@robertwiblin](https://twitter.com/robertwiblin) as an interviewer, the term applies quite well.

So imagine what a treat for my ears [the podcast with them both](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/max-roser-our-world-in-data/)
has been! Lots of background on one of the best sites on the interwebs. If you know it only for its statistics
about the CoVid19-pandemic, make sure to check out their other topics as well!
