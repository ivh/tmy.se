Last night I re-watched **Tron** from 1982. And just now I glanced at Claude's thinking where it reasoned about what "the user" wants, that is me. This struck me as very similar to how the "programs" in Tron talk about the mythical "users", which they are not even sure exists and whose wished need to be guessed. Very prescient of the film-makers!
