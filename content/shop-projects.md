My tool shed and workshop is rather narrow, so when I borrowed my neighbour's table saw the other day,
the first thing I did was to build a cart on wheels/castors for it, to be able to rasily move it out of the way. At the same time
I made my workbench mobile the same way and ensured that the height of the two matched, so that the bench can serve
as an outfeed-table for long pieces from the saw.

[This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKSJctIdbcA) served as the main inspiration for the cart, but I simplified it even more and skipped the
drawers for a plain storage shelf underneath the saw. I can recommend [Steve Ramsey's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/stevinmarin/videos)
throughout; I have watched quite a few of his videos and found them both instructive and entertaining.
