I admit, when I started running some eight-or-so years ago, my first smartphone
with a GPS-tracker was a strong factor in keeping the motivation up. The
feeling of "living the future" was fun, and measuring exactly how far and how
fast I was going made progress easily visible.

In the meantime I've "logged" most of my exercise, be it runs, hikes, cycling,
or skating on Swedish winter lakes. But I never got into wearing a
heart-rate-monitor, or tracking my weight more than twice a year. Plus, I
rarely checked the long-term statistics of my exercises - after all I had
reached a level of fitness that I am satisfied with and lack the ambition to
reach any lofty goals.

So instead of going along with the "quantified-self" movement, wearing a
step-counter with unobtrusive heart-rate monitor, or tracking my diet, I
recently found myself not even bothering to turn on the tracker-app when I bike
20km to work, and back. Running without a GPS-watch lets you pick up some
mushrooms and look around for more, without the nagging feeling that your
average speed statistic will be messed up by this. I generally prefer not being
in a hurry and physical effort does not need to come with feeling rushed.

Then there is the whole data privacy aspect. Do I want everybody to exercise
more and be healthier? Sure. Do I want insurance companies to punish people who
are not willing to prove their exercise by sending them their "quantified self"
data? I think not.

Whereever data accumulates, it creates desires from companies and governments
to use it for originally unintended purposes.
