I almost just went to bed for some reading\* when I caught it just in time that I had not blogged yet today.
A catastrophe it would certainly not have been, but I like to keep the streak alive for now, however trivial
the post turns out to be.

It is funny to observe the own mind in caring about such trivial things like streaks, points or badges, in
whatever gamified context they appear. Will it rebel eventually, when one part of the brain gets tricked
by another part, in this case me trying to consciously exploit some built-in mechanism for motivational
gains? Probably not, the automatic "primitive" bits are not aware of context.

Viewing one's own mind not as a single unified entity, but a mess of different motivations, feelings and
thoughts, often conflicting ones, can be helpful and generally rings true to me. You can make up a theory of 
[willpower](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/towards-a-bayesian-theory-of-willpower) this way, or
call out the "internal press sectretary" that tries to weave a flattering story out of the underlying mess,
as Simler & Hanson describe in _The Elephant in the Brain_.

Not very pretty to look at up close, what these brains of ours are up to.


(\* still the LessWrong books and a new one on the Viking age, called _River Kings_.)
