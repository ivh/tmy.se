I [mentioned _Scout Mindset_]({filename}scout-julia.md), the new book by Julia Galef, just the other day. Now I am two
thirds through the audio book, read by herself, and can wholeheartedly recommend it once more. It is quite close to
what I expected from it.

One chapter is about _calibrating beliefs_, that is not only being aware of _what_ you belive to be right, but also
_how confident_ you are about that, by assigning a probability to beliefs being correct. Then, in her own words:

> Being perfectly calibrated would mean that your “50% sure” claims are in fact
> correct 50 percent of the time, your “60% sure” claims are correct 60 percent
> of the time, your “70% sure” claims are correct 70 percent of the time, and
> so on. Perfect calibration is an abstract ideal, not something that’s
> possible to achieve in reality. Still, it’s a useful benchmark against which
> to compare yourself.

She then provides [opportunity to practice](https://juliagalef.com/calibration/) by
answering trivia questions. This was more fun than I expected and you should click
there right now and spend a few minutes on this!

I say this not only because it just so happened that I did well this time: My
guesses about which I was 55%, 65%, 75%, 85% and 95% certain, turned out to
be 50%, 67%, 80%, 100% and 100% correct, respectively. Probably a fluke.
