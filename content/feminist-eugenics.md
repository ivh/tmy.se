Eugenics is apparently making a comeback, for example with some
[Chinese Feminists](https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1007117/the-curious-case-of-chinas-feminist-eugenicists#)
([via](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/05/tuesday-assorted-links-312.html)).
Maybe surprisingly, this is [nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sanger#Eugenics).

This is of course a very thorny issue. On the one hand it is an uncomfortable
and seldom spoken about thruth, that women partially choose their parters for
the expected quality of their offspring, that is for their genes. Quality can
mean different things in different contexts and I see nothing morally wrong
with this being a factor for someone, consciously or not.  Who would want to
deny the freedom of mate choice?

On the other hand, eugenics has a bad reputation, and righfully so with regard
to forced sterilizations and the Nazi killings.  If however, and that is a
strong if, the benefits from selection could be achieved without actually
harming anybody in the process, then the matter becomes quite different, I
think. Embryos are already selected to some extent in IVF. And the potential
upside is huge, especially with [multiple iterations of
selection](https://www.gwern.net/Embryo-selection).  Once it becomes possible
and cheaper, there will be strong incentives for parents to get smarter kids.
And societies will probably benefit from it, if the ethical concerns can be
solved.

If I remember correctly, this is also a topic in [_Blueprint_ by Robert
Plomin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39074555-blueprint), a book that I
enjoyed last year and apprently forgot to write about.
