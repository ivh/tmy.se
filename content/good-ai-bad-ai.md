I notice it in myself, and in the vibes on the interwebs: this dissonance
between on the one hand loving how useful AI is for oneself, and at the same time being
annoyed when others use it "on you", or force you to use a bad one.

The examples are aplenty. [Slop bug reports](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2025/07/14/death-by-a-thousand-slops/), all the companies that try to use chatbots for support questions, and the general feeling that companies [push AI a bit too hard](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/02/zig_quits_github_microsoft_ai_obsession/) down our throats.

But when [used
right](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/02/zig_quits_github_microsoft_ai_obsession/)
and with [taste]({filename}use-ai-to-explore-and-enable.md), it can be
fantastic. This is not a contradiction; both the good and the bad exist, and the gap between them
will probably only get larger.

A good rule-of-thumb for oneself may be to not make anyone read or interact
with AI slop against their will. That means having read and understood AI-generated things to a
degree that one feels comfortable standing for it, before sharing. Alternatively being very clear about when this is not the case, so that everyone can choose they level of attention accordingly.
