How difficult it is to consistently post on a blog! One easily gets awe-stricken by people like
[Tyler](https://marginalrevolution.com/) or [Scott](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)
who put out large amounts of interesting material, without having this as their main gig.

I won't pretend I'll be able to get to their level anytime soon, but starting small
and from scratch again should make it easier to form [new habits](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/bj-fogg/).
And practice matters in writing, they say.

To put it in different words: I have [outsourced my babble](https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/babble/)
to podcasts and books too much, and need to flex my own text
generator again. Re-phrasing thoughts fosters their synthesis.
