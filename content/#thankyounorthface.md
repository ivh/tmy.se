North Face, the outdoor clothing brand, apparently refused to
sell to an oil company jackets with their logo on it. Which 
prompted [this quite funny response](https://twitter.com/AndrewHClark/status/1400613801272152064),
which shows that 90% of North Face's product line is made out of
petroleum products.

I think it is fair to point out such hypocrisy, assuming that the
story is indeed as told. 
Coming from the oil industry, the video of course makes it sound
like a good thing to produce 
clothes out of oil based raw materials, thus #ThankYouNorthFace.

This could easily be spun into a campaign of shaming the
company for that very fact. But that would be an example
of well-meaning environmentalism gone bad, because
contrary to energy production it is often much less
resource intensive, and therefore environmentally friendly,
to make things from plastic, compared to "organic" materials.

The prime example of this are plastic shopping bags that have been
banned or taxed in many places after an outrage some year ago. Never mind that 
the paper bag that replaced it takes ten times more resources to
produce and cannot have a second use as waste bag.
