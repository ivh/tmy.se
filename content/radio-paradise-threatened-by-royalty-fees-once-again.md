[Radio Paradise](http://www.radioparadise.com) is an internet radio
station, run solely through the voluntary support from listeners. It is
such a good station, with hand-picked playlists from a great variety of
genres and no ads, that I have been listening regularly for over a
decade and sent them money several times.

Now, the same as a few years ago, the royalty organizations want to
change the deal on how much money they get and it threatens to make
small stations such as Radio Paradise impossible. Read all about it in
the [open letter from Radio Paradise to David
Byrne](http://www.radioparadise.com/byrne).
