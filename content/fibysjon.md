I took the drone our for a spin this chilly early spring morning. The picture shows
the nearby lake, _Fibysjön_, just a few hundred meters through the forest from our
place.

Around it you can see some areas where the trees have recently been taken down. In fact,
I see several huge trucks passing by every day, loaded to the brim with logs.
The [harvesters](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=skog+sk%C3%B6rdare&t=ffab&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images)
that do the logging are impressive machines and so efficient that they can process
up to a hundred trees per hour.

There is an ongoing debate, heated at times, between the enviromental movement, 
forest owners and industry, about how to strike the balance between logging
and preservation. The more I read about it, the less of a strong opinion
I find myself to maintain in that regard. I intend to write up the arguments
soon, but as a teaser, if you can read Swedish,
