So this is what 4000 saplings look like; I was quite unsure how many boxes this would
turn out to be. They were delivered yesterday, in frozen state, and now they
have to thaw in the shadow for a few days before 
the boxes get opened and the seedlings [planted]({filename}planting-trees.md) as quickly as possible. It looks like
there is a rainy week coming up, which should be perfect.
