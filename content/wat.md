Another quote from [yesterday's]({filename}old-ideas.md)
[podcast](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-moynihan-prior-generations/#communicating-progress-031507):

I have encountered this too, and it drives me nuts! The naturalistic fallacy
in action.
Maybe there is something to this analogy, as an explanation for this attitude:

> Humanity is kind of in this almost adolescent phase, where it has for the

Let's all grow up together, shan't we? And become [responsible stewards]({filename}geoengineering.md)
of our planet, and beyond.
