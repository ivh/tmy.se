Since I [just]({filename}thankyounorthface.md) claimed that plastic bags are
good, in spite of their bad reputation, here is [a video that goes through
some numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzvM9tf5s0).

The only thing I can add is that the pollution aspect very much depends on
where you are in the world. If that place has a working system of garbage
collection and management, then it is very unlikely that a plastic
bag ends up in the oceans. So maybe we should spend the money that 
plastic bans cost on helping poorer places improving their
waste management to pollute less.

In any case, I'll happily continue to buy plastic bags, reuse
them a few times before they become garbage bags. And pay the
counterproductive tax that would rather have me buy something
worse.
