Song lyrics rarely stick with me, but this
sentence from
[Ane Brun's _Do you remember_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF295qTZRgw)
always has:

> Do you remember when we forgot<br>
> How to smile at each other<br>
> To believe that the other<br>
> Wants only what's good for you


Genuine goodwill is probably an
essential ingredient for lasting friendships
and relationships. And it is not even that hard
to muster once one is aware of it and decides
that this is the right attitude to take.
