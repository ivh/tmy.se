We awoke to -20°C this morning in Bruksvallarna, after spending much of
yesterday driving northward to get here. Still, here in the region of
Härjedalen we are only in the middle of Sweden, when it comes to it's
large north-south extent.

Bruksvallarna is known for cross-country skiing. The tracks were a bit icy
today, but the forecast promises fresh snow for tomorrow.
