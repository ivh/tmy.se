It will soon be time to replace my current laptop, a three
year old Thinkpad X230; it probably is my fifth X-series over
the years. They deservedly had a good reputation for build
quality, and to run Linux.

However, I find it unlikey that my next machine will be another
Thinkpad. Partly because of Lenovo's Superfish and [BIOS

debacles, partly because their latest machines are just not as
good anymore. (For example I don't quite like the new-style keyboard of the X230 and onward, plus it broke down twice and needed the mainboard replaced).

Criteria for a new laptop would be the following:

* fan-less
* non-glossy screen, ~ 12-13"
* digital video-out
* good keyboard, Swedish
* 16GB RAM
* decent size SSD
* track-point
* runs Linux without too much hassle.

Things like CPU-power, battery-life, weight and screen
resolution are less important. Nevertheless, I am not aware of
a machine that fulfills the above. The Dell XPS 13 seems to
come close, but it still has a fan and no track-point. A Macbook Air is out of the question.

If you have a suggestion, let me know!
