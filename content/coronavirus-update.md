What's up, folks? I hope you so far made it safely through the pandemic and its effetcs on everything else!

After my initial spurt of interest in Feburary and March when I followed the situation closely, once
everyone was taking it seriously and it became "all hands on deck", I relaxed and left it to the pros.
Arm-chair opinions are usually not my thing and keeping in mind a relatively high level of uncertainty about
the state of the world is something that I have become familiar with.

Just as one example, it is still open for analysis and debate, whether the Swedish way to handle COVID-19
without a strong lock-down turns out to be good or bad. There are many facets to this and things are 
complex enough to maintain some modesty in one's opinions and utterances.

I am among the lucky ones that have experienced very little negative impact. Working from home is something
I had done weeks at a time for several years. Being isolated comes somewhat naturally to me.
Plus, I made a wise decision in the spring, once it became clear that some projects were put
on hiatus anyway, to take a temporary partial leave from work.
Therefore I have had plenty of time this spring and summer for other things. Mostly forestry, carpentry and
wood-working  -  more on that later! And brewing more tasty beers, of course.
