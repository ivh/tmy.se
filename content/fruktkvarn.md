Running a small farm implies a constant stream of things to fix. The image shows 
an example of when the fruit grinder (to the right) in our juicery broke down.
The motor fried itself towards the end of the season and I was hesitant to make the
investment of a new one for just two remaining days.

Thus, one of the old motors that 
one naturally accumulates had to drive it externally with a belt. At first I did not gut
the old motor which made it melt a second time thanks to induction -- lesson learned. The
receiving axle is not perpendicular to the floor, so I made the angle of the other one
adjustable together with the belt tension, by using one of the most important tools of all,
a ratchet strap.
