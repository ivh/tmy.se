I happened to be in Brussels for this year's installement of
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) and it sure is an amazing free
event, pulled off by a lot of voluntary work.

The plan was to have a short writeup and comment on the talks
I listened to, but I rather spent the time watching some more
talks in their recorded form. So I recommend you pick by your
interests and do the same: [Saturday](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/day/saturday/),
[Sunday](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/day/sunday/)

At least I got around to showing a few tidbits to fellow
astronomers. [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rTwSeapO60H7y5nwCKe-Eq-3BvmeFfWNY3tBtRnbNP4/edit?usp=sharing)
