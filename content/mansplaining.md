You certainly have heard of the term *mansplaining*, meaning to condescendingly
explain something while falsely assuming the explainee is ignorant of the
subject matter; typically executed by a male on a female.

While this certainly exists and is often pointed out rightfully (and
[hilariously](https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/733589151166156801)), there is
a related aspect that I think should not be confused with mansplaining.
Remember this old XKDC:

[![XKCD 1053]({photo}ten_thousand.png)](https://xkcd.com/1053/)

Combined it with the attitude that we all know very little, that it is fun to learn
new things and that there is no prestige involved in knowing more or less, we can
easily find ourselves "involuntarily mansplaining". This situation, even if it
lacks the misjudgment of expertise and the condescension, can be perceived as
mansplaining.

Should it? Maybe. After all, in this case, the explainer has misconceved not
the knowledge of the explainee, but the mind set and presence of the
aforementioned attitude, resulting in a failure of human interaction. On the
other hand, we might not want to stifle open exchange of ideas too much by
being afraid of appearing mansplaining.
