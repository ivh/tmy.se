Recently, the book I have enjoyed most is Joe Henrich's _The Secret of Our Success_. The subtitle says very well what it is about:
_How Culture Is Driving Human Evolution, Domesticating Our Species, and Making Us Smarter_. I found the interaction between
culture and biology totally mind-boggling and think that this is one of those great books that synthesize different areas of
understanding into a compelling narrative, in a very accessible and entertaining way. Here is a [good interview with him, by Tyler
Cowen](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/joe-henrich-culture-evolution-weird-psychology-social-norms-9756a97850ce), if
you want to get a preview.  
Henrich has a new book out, _The WEIRDest people in the world_ 
[(review by Dan Dennet)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/books/review/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-joseph-henrich.html),
which I am eager to read  -  alas my copy is stuck in the mail.

If one takes "big picture" books as a genre, then Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs and Steel_ certainly is one of the most prominent
examples. I had not read it until last year and liked it very much. I continued straight on to his follow-up _Collapse_ but
have so far passed on the latest one, _Upheaval_.

_Why we Sleep_ by Matthew Walker did not leave a permanent impression on me, mostly because I needed no convincing that sleeping
is important. I easily
average 8,5 hours per night and generally sleep well. What really peaked my interest though was 
[this fantastic blog post](https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/) that goes though the first chapter of the book and finds
a plethora of errors; very worthwhile to check out!

Back to cultural evolution. _This View of Life_ by David Sloan Wilson was certainly interesting as well, but not as captivating to
my brain as Henrich's book above. The question whether group selection is real or not gets mixed into the subject matter and I find the
debate around this both confusing and semantic at times.

Last for today is Camus' _The Plague_. I stumbled upon my old copy, in German translation, which I must have read many years ago.
But I remembered nothing of ot when I started reading the other day. It is of course very well written, but also a bit dense,
which is why I only get a few pages further every night in bed.
