Last night I read [this piece](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/)
in one of the [Lesswrong books](https://www.lesswrong.com/books) (pictured).

And just now [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kW9gBM9Qw) flew by on Twitter. It is about
_meta discussion_, the sphinx that both derails and guards conversations, be they with others or yourself.
