A quick follow-up on the [previous post](/the-future-is-near),
here are a few links to satisfy your thirst for more input
about AI and related topics.

[MIRI's blog](https://intelligence.org/blog/) seems to do a good job at collecting updates.

[This recent conference](http://futureoflife.org/2015/10/12/ai-safety-conference-in-puerto-rico/) has put up PDFs of several presentations.

Eliezer Yudkowsky is on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky), so is [Demis Hassabis](https://twitter.com/demishassabis) from DeepMind.

I also got Kurzweil's famous book *The Singularity Is
Near* and will read it soon. Other's have convinced me
that his thinking probably is way too optimistic, in the sense
that while his predictions may be possible, they are not the
default outcome. But it is certainly a worthwhile read anyway.

[*The Second Machine Age*](http://secondmachineage.com/) by Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee made it onto my reading list as well.

The [Foom debate](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/The_Hanson-Yudkowsky_AI-Foom_Debate) is often referred to. I however cannot understand how some claim that Hanson "won" with his arguments against a fast take-off.

Nick Bostrom's latest paper is [here (PDF)](http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/openness.pdf) and his recent talk [Safety Issues in Advanced AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gTPZUjvNdE) is basically an updated version of his "classic" [talk at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pywF6ZzsghI).

Also very much worth to watch is [Demis Hassabis - The Future of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fjmnOQuqao).

Oh, and if you don't know Yudkowsky's short [Three Worlds Collide](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/) yet, go and read it - it's deep and funny!

What strikes me in of all this is how young the whole field is.
Even five or ten years ago, the main concepts and jargon that
seem to make quite a bit of sense once you get them explained
to you, were not in place at all.
