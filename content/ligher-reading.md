A few weeks ago, I bought and started reading _The World of the Crusades_ by Christopher Tyerman.
I don't even remember where I saw the book recommended or what made it sound like a good idea, but I admit 
that the crusades have always been a bit of a gap in my overall layman's picture of history. What were they,
actually, how important, and most of all _why_â€½

This book is a bit dense though. While well made, written and illustrated, I rarely make it more than ten pages
per night, before I fall asleep. The author has a tendency toward unnecessarily high-brow language
but I think it is more the choice of which details to highlight, and the lack of connection between them,
that makes it feel tedious to me.

Thus, I will put it aside for a while and dive into some lighter summer reading: The [Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series)
by Iain M. Banks, which I have heard many good things about over the years but never read.
