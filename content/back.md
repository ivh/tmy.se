You probably have not noticed, but this site was offline for twelve days. And so was I.

This is because the glass fiber link that leads to our home in the forest was broken in connection
with some work further down the road. Then the usual fuckups of privatized and distributed responsibilities
ensued. Meaning that I had to lean hard on our network _provider_ (ISP) to finally refer the issue to 
the network _operator_ after 5 days. And then another week to get the technician to diagnose, and talk to
the other company that caused the fault.

This is the kind of thing that would have easily annoyed the hell out of younger me - things not working
as they should! The world is mean to me!!

This time, though, I was quite fine with it. I am on holidays anyway and can in fact build a new
 shed for firewood without internet access (pics will follow!). The notifications for emails had been turned off anyway
 and for urgent stuff we still had the 4G of our phones - so there really only remained the inconvenience that
we imagined ourselves.

Still, it's good to be back online.
