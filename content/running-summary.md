The following is a copy of an earlier post on social media, summarizing
how my running went since I started in 2008 aged 30, not fit at all and
never having done any sports or training before then.

The Stockholm half marathon 2009 was the first big goal and quite
painful. Late 2009 I switched to thin (so called “minimalistic” or
“barefoot”) shoes which contributed to getting me hooked on running. I
overdid it in summer 2010 (hairline fracture in right foot) which ended
that season early for me. 2011 finally felt like a breakthrough with
both increased ease and speed; that summer I also joined Runday, an
informal club, for a technical training session once in a while. There
was more than 20 minutes difference between my first 10km-race 2009 and
2011’s last.

Winter 2011/12 was the first without a long break in running. During
2012 I ran my first marathon, did 5k in 20:20 and a half marathon in
1:35; I also took off my shoes more often and ran barefoot on shorter
trails and road, up to 12km.

2013 and 2014 were somewhat similar. The enthusiasm of the first years
has waned and my laziness saw to it that I did not progress much, but
kept a steady level instead. Some barefoot runs and a marathon at the
end of the season, with too few long runs during training.
