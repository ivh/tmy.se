Two of the podcasts I listen to just covered a similar topic: How societies handle
disaster, why we usually are unprepared, and how we could do better. Both are
above the usual crop and thus highly recommended!

[Sean Carroll talks to Niall Ferguson](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/05/03/145-niall-ferguson-on-histories-networks-and-catastrophes/)
about a large variety of things. Too many bits of wisdom to even
try picking a quote from the transcript.

[Sam Harris brings on Rob Reid](https://samharris.org/subscriber-extras/special-episode-engineering-apocalypse/)
who delivers a riveting monologue, broken up by discussion, that vividly outlines why synthetic biology 
can pose a real threat, and what can be done to put countermeasures into place early enough. Four hours 
well spent!
