Working from home is nothing new for me, I have been doing it some weeks
at a time for several years. But now that more and more collegues do the same
and use teleconferencing tools and apps, I got a small upgrade for my setup:
A goose-neck tablet holder, so that it can become a dedicated second screen
exclusively for telecons, freeing precious space on the main screen.

Decent video and audio quality are important for collaborating remotely,
I believe. And a camera that is positioned such that you look up to it,
rather than looking down into, makes a less imposing and awkward image,
thereby contributing to a more pleasant atmosphere.
