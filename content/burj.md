The [latest video by Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFCbJmgeHmA) is 
about the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs, and is brilliant as usual.
This frame made me pause and ponder on a side-track:

Doesn't the Burj Khalifa tower look surprisingly large compared to
mount everest? It isn't even a fair picture, because the mountain
does not rise 8.8km out of the ocean, but "only" about 3.5km above the
surrounding valleys.

Thus, climbing Burj Khalifa (which is a thing people [do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa#Climbing))
just five times is the same height as climbing Everest from base camp. Disregarding the lack of oxygen at high altitudes
and that the tower is much steeper.

Human-made structures start to approach the size of mountains, pointing up,
not only [down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine).
