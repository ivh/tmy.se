While chopping wood earlier today, I listened to [this FLI podcast with Joscha
Bach](https://futureoflife.org/2021/03/31/joscha-bach-and-anthony-aguirre-on-digital-physics-and-moving-towards-beneficial-futures/)
in which he says:

> We obviously live in a dream universe. And the dream is dreamed by a mind on
> a higher plane of existence and that is implemented in the skull of a
> primate. In the brain of some primate that is walking around in a physical
> universe. This is our best hypothesis that we have. And so we can explain all
> the magic that you’re experiencing by the fact that indeed we live in a dream
> generated in that skull.

> And now the question is, how does consciousness come about? How is it
> possible that the physical system can be experiencing things? And the answer
> is no, it can’t. A physical system cannot experience anything. Experience is
> only possible in a dream. It’s a virtual property. Our existence as
> experiencing beings is entirely virtual, it’s not physical. Which means we
> are only experiencing things inside of the model. It’s part of the model that
> we experience something.

> For the neurons, it doesn’t feel like anything to do this. For the brain, it
> doesn’t feel like anything. But it would be very useful for the brain [to know], what
> it would be like to be a person. So it generates a story about that person.
> About the feelings of that person, the relationship that this person has with
> the environment, and it acts on that model. And the model gets updated, as
> part of that behavior.

This is quite dense and almost incomprehensible without a lot of prior knowledge
that is not yet obvious to "normies" like myself. I had to turn down the listening
speed to 1x, which I rarely need to, but I think I got the gist of it.

It reminds me of [Anil Seth's TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality)
where he argues that coscious awareness is a hallucination contrained by reality, whereas a dream has no such contraints.

Mind-blowing stuff to think about, maybe literally so.
