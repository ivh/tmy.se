Our small farm has some forest attached, and we have a tractor from the 80s
with an old winch/crane to get logs out. Earlier this year, I cleaned out an
old barn and put in a Woodmizer sawmill. Autumn and winter are the right time
for forest work, so I took most of yesterday to do just that.

I had felled a tree that was killed by bark beetles last summer, meaning that
it has had time to dry while standing already and the lunber can be used right
away. I managed to pull out a double length (~9.5m) log to the saw, just 200m
away, and cut it in two there.

Then I rolled in onto the saw which turned it into 2-by-8s (50x200mm). Below
are a few pictures of the process, click to enlarge. And if you happen to be
local to the Östhammar region, we're open for business: info (in Swedish) at
