The aforementioned freshly-built woodshed. Apart from the three old pallets that serve as floor, this
is made completely from lumber that I made myself, from trees that needed to be taken down
because of bark bettles.

Not sure yet, if it will get plainted in the same Falu red as the house, or allowed
to grey on its own.
