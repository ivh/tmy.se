I have updated the plot on the [COVID19 page]({filename}pages/covid19.md)
as ususal, and here is a new version of the one that tries to align the cuves with
each other by shifting them in time:

This is scary in the sense that many places will probably look like Italy
within days. Exponential grows is unintuitive and easily surprises systems
and people that function linearly. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg)
does a great job illustrating the numbers behind an epidemic - highly
recommended watch!

There is hope, of course, and the [dire situation in Italy](https://twitter.com/jasonvanschoor/status/1237142891077697538)
need not be a prediction for the rest of the world.
This is because we already have an example of a large outbreak
that was brought under control:

They report a declining number of new cases and have [tested](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-testing-covid-19-tests-per-capita-chart-us-behind-2020-3?r=US&IR=T)
3.6â€° of their population, more than any other country.

Social distancing is a major tool in this effort, more on this
in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/T_Inglesby/status/1237138117464715270).
