**Star Trek**. Hearing that name makes people's eyes either sparkle, or roll. Unlike
*Star Wars* it never became fully mainstream and Trekkies are still considered to
be quite dorky. I was born too late to have a sentimental relation to the original series, but *Next
Generation* with Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard had 11-year-old me glued
to the TV every afternoon. I loved it!

Ten years or so later, I re-watched it in English, instead of the German dubbing.
This made it much better with respect to the voices, of course, but the magic that I remembered
was gone. Some of the episodes were quite bad and it hurt a bit to realize that.
Yes, I also watched DS9 and Voyager, but only
half-heartedly, and never became a fan.

Another doubling of lifetime later (ðŸ™„) I recently found myself, for unclear reasons,
intrigued by the idea to watch the Star Trek *films* once more. I think I had seen
them all at least once, but never together and I barely remembered most of them. So
I did, and regret nothing!

*I: The Motion Picture*. This is a very slow film and I almost pressed the button to speed it up.
But I was surprised by how
good the special effects still look today. I had this mental image of the old Enterprise being
just crappy and ugly - not any more. 4/5

*II: The Wrath of Khan*. This one has its moments, but I didn't like it as much as some do. In fact,
I have already forgotten most of it again. Still, 3/5.

*III: The Search for Spock*. This was fun, mostly because of Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon. The 
solemn parts on Vulcan and Kirk having a son had me looking at my watch, however. 3/5

*IV: The Voyage Home*. Even more fun than the last! Yes, time-travel is a cheap trick and can go 
horribly wrong story-wise, but it did not bother me here. Scotty putting complex formulae
onto an 80s computer screen by pressing three buttons made me laugh out loud.
4/5

*V: The Final Frontier*. Yeah, this is everything as bad as its reputation. All the films are much
more enjoyable, if you manage to have as much fun *at* the film as *with* it. This is especially
true for this one. 1/5

*VI: The Undiscovered Country*. 
More serious in tone and with lots of pink CGI-blood. 
The ending is a bit of a mess, but overall very watchable. Interesting to see the 
Klingons change, here they are much closer to TNG than to TOS. 3/5

*VII: Generations*. Wow. I had vague good memories from this one, but it is as bad as the popular verdict suggests. 
It just doesn't make any sense! I noticed several occasions when CGI-shots were re-used in the earlier films and
here we are shown the exact same explosion of the Klingon ship as in the last film.
2/5

*VIII: First Contact*. The borg are a favourite story-line from TNG and they make good enemies here, too. 
We get to see them take over a brand-new ship, the Enterprise-E.
Getting rid of the large neck and making it smaller than the previous one
are good choices - she looks good! The scenes on time-travel Earth are very light-hearted and if you accept the quirky humour,
they work nicely to contrast the dire situation on the ship. Overall my favourite of the bunch, 5/5. In case
it is not clear yet, ratings are relative within this list, I am not saying that First Contact is among
the best films I have ever seen.

*IX: Insurrection*. This one I vaguely remembered as quite boring, but I did not dislike it this time around.
The intrigue is fine, the villains are clichÃ© baddies that look the part. Even the romance, often
the worst part of any Star Trek, did not bother me. Don't get me wrong, a masterpiece it is not.
3/5

*X: Nemesis*. Well, I cannot quite put my finger on why, but this was not very good. The central 
question of identity and personality, and how much of it is "nature versus nurture" is a
long-standing and important one, but how it was handled here felt shallow and stale. The final battle
was not too bad, but Data's death was rushed. An unworthy finale, 2/5.

But maybe it is wrong to call it that. After all, they made [*Picard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Picard)
last year, the series that brought "the band" back together. 
I have seen it, but it did not leave a lasting impression.
They say there will be a second season which I do not anticipate much, I just learned about it from the Wikipedia article
myself. I will probably watch it anyway, in another vain attempt to get the nostalgia flowing.
