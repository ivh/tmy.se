Some long time ago, probably around 2005, I got convinced that I
should use _vi_ for quick edits in the terminal, instead of _nano_
which I had been using for this purpose, for historical reasons.

So I added this simple line to my `.bash_aliases`:

```bash
alias nano='vim'
```

And to this day I type _nano_ when I just quickly want to edit a
file, just out of muscle memory, and I would be very surprised if
I would end up in actual _nano_, not _vim_.
